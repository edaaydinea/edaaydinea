**AI Research Engineer in Neuroscience | Cognitive AI Scientist**

## About Me

I am an AI Research Engineer working at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence and healthcare**, with a focused interest in **neuropathic pain and neuroscience**. My expertise spans **AI research in neuroscience, NLP and Large Language Model (LLM) engineering, and cognitive data science**, allowing me to approach complex biological and cognitive problems from both research and applied perspectives. Driven in part by a personal connection to chronic pain, my work is centered on translating advanced AI methodologies into clinically meaningful and interpretable models. My long-term goal is to develop **AI-driven diagnostic and predictive systems for neuropathic pain** that enable early risk identification and treatment response forecasting, contributing to interdisciplinary research and industry-aligned development in personalized pain management.
